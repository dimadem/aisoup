Moog has announced the release of a new semi-modular synth, Labyrinth.

Labyrinth is described with the tagline: “How deep does the rabbit hole go? Meet Labyrinth, an idea machine that aims to answer that very question.”

The semi-modular hardware features dual generative sequencers which use “chance operations” to construct unique melodic pathways, which then develop by themselves to create “a mesmerising path of sound", according to Moog.

This means that, while notes can be selected as parameters for a sequence in whichever order or rhythm they're played, it's completely random — but they can be quantised or set to a specific key.

Two oscillators make up the core of the hardware, creating “parallel analog signal paths” with the description explaining that it “shines when adding colour to the static backdrop of a drum pattern or bassline".

The description adds that while Labyrinth is “fully capable of standing on its own, or adding depth to your existing rack, it’s equally at home in a live set or at the centre of a humble bedroom studio.”

The synthesiser also contains a “comprehensive patch bay” with 32 available patches enabling a huge range of MIDI processing as well as the ability to connect to other modular synths, which can then be controlled by the synth’s extensive collection of synthesis controls.

Moog’s Labyrinth is the latest edition of their semi-modular family, following on from the release of the Spectravox in May.
