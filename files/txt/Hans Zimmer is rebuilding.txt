Hans Zimmer is working with AJHSynth to rebuild the BBC Maida Vale’s legendary synth collection from the 1960s and 70s.

The fabled composer and music producer, known for his work on films such as Interstellar, Inception and Lion King, has now lent his expertise to AJSynth to create a "one-of-a-kind, everything- but-the-kitchen-sink-style super-synth."

The synth has been designed together from the ground up as an “uncompromised analogue modular system, a sonic creation tool without equal,” complete with 40 individual modules, spanning a plethora of effects, envelopes, oscillators, and filters.

The system is named after the BBC’s RadioPhonic workshop in Maida Vale, a studio recently acquired by Hans Zimmer after he made the “maybe not-so-stupid decision to buy it," — fulfilling his aim of recreating the studio which inspired and facilitated so many early electronic musicians.

The synth will take centre stage in the RadioPhonic workshop, and Hans’ input is crucial in the depth of the synthesiser, with AJHSynth writing in a statement: “No one has a better understanding of what sounds pleasing and how to use it best."

"When Hans says that a particular synth sounds more engaging and fuller than others then he is speaking from a position of experience and authority,” the manufacturer continues.

The first completed synth is set to be unveiled by AJHSynth at this May’s SUPERBOOTH24 music convention in Berlin.
